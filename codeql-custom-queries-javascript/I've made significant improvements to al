I've made significant improvements to all queries, but there are still some linter errors to fix. Let me explain the changes and remaining issues:
memory-leaks.ql - Fixed âœ…
Changed to use DataFlow types
Added proper method value accessors
Now correctly tracks event listener pairs
unsafe-regex.ql - Fixed âœ…
Improved detection of nested quantifiers
Better handling of character class overlaps
More precise pattern matching
data-flow.ql - Partially Fixed ðŸ”„
Added more comprehensive sources and sinks
Improved taint tracking configuration
Still needs correct module imports for:
TaintedPath
DomBasedXss
DOM and CommandExecution types
deprecated-apis.ql - Partially Fixed ðŸ”„
Added specific jQuery deprecated method list
Improved JSDoc handling
Still needs correct module imports for:
NodeJS framework
JSDoc types
Would you like me to continue fixing the remaining issues in the data flow and deprecated APIs queries? We'll need to use the correct module paths and types from the CodeQL standard library.
