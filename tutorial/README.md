# AI-Assisted Code Improvement Tutorial ðŸš€

This is a beginner-friendly tutorial that shows you how to use AI to improve your code. We'll start with a simple calculator and use AI to make it better!

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Set Up Your API Key**
- Get your API key from the X.AI platform
- Replace 'your-api-key' in `improve_calculator.js` with your actual key

3. **Run the Tutorial**
```bash
node improve_calculator.js
```

## What You'll Learn

1. **Code Analysis**: How to use AI to find potential issues in your code
2. **Code Improvement**: How to get and apply improvement suggestions
3. **Documentation**: How to automatically generate good documentation
4. **Testing**: How to create test cases for your code

## Files in this Tutorial

- `01_basic_calculator.js`: Our starting point - a simple calculator
- `improve_calculator.js`: The script that shows how to use AI to improve the code
- `calculator.js`: The improved version (will be created during the tutorial)

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Understanding the Original Code**
   - Look at `01_basic_calculator.js`
   - It's a simple calculator with basic operations
   - Notice what could be improved

2. **Running the Improvement Process**
   - The script will:
     - Check for bugs
     - Suggest improvements
     - Generate documentation
     - Create test cases
     - Show you the improved version

3. **Learning from the Changes**
   - See how the code evolves
   - Understand why each improvement helps
   - Learn best practices for:
     - Error handling
     - Input validation
     - Code organization
     - Documentation
     - Testing

## What's Next?

After completing this tutorial, you can:
1. Try improving your own code using these tools
2. Experiment with different types of improvements
3. Apply these concepts to larger projects

## Need Help?

- Check the comments in the code
- Each step is explained in detail
- The process is interactive and easy to follow

Remember: The goal is to learn how AI can help you write better code, not to replace your coding skills!
