Swagger UI and SDK Development: The initial request mentions using Swagger UI to develop an SDK. This suggests a more structured API with defined endpoints, which aligns with the XAIApi class. A chat and completions API might not necessarily have this level of structure or require an SDK in the same way.
In summary, while both involve API calls and authentication, the XAIApi class you provided is designed for specific tasks related to function calling and code manipulation, whereas a typical chat and completions API is more focused on text generation and conversation. The XAIApi seems to be a custom implementation for a specific set of functionalities, likely tailored to the needs of the X AI API as described in your initial request.
